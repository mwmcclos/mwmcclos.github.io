    <p>The streaming service Twitch celebrated its 10 year anniversary over the summer and has created a community of millions of viewers and creators. But what is Twitch? And what makes it stand out amongst other websites? </p>

    <p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch is centered around live streams. Instead of watching an edited, prerecorded video, viewers get to share a live experience with the creator. The website seems to be focused on creating strong, like-minded communities.</p>

    <p>“Your creative content thrives here. Bring your passions; we’ll help you build a community around them,” the website says. </p>

    <p>On the Apple App Store, the app is called “Twitch: Live Game Streaming,” with the promise of gaming content right in the name, but data indicate that the platform may be moving in a different direction. </p>

    <p>Streams under the category “Just Chatting” have surpassed all gaming streams and have consistently been the most viewed since May of 2020, according to a dataset by Ran Kirshenboim.</p>

     <div class="card" style="width: 85%;">

<p>As viewers spend more time on the platform, “Just Chatting” streams are becoming more and more popular. The dataset says the “Just Chatting” category reached its peak popularity last April. In just that month, viewers watched these streams for 289,547,911 hours. 
</p>

<p>Brett Rubin is a senior at Syracuse University, and he started using Twitch more often when the world shut down in March 2020. He doesn’t like the “Just Chatting” genre, but he said he has noticed the streams’ increasing popularity on the site. 
</p>

<p>“When you go to browse and then you click genres, as of lately, the just chatting slash IRL section has been at the top of the recommended list because the viewership has been skyrocketing,” he said. 
</p>

<p>Joey Sciarra is a sophomore at ESF, and he uses twitch about twice a week, sometimes as a streamer and sometimes as a viewer. Though some Twitch streamers like Rubin want to focus on the games, Sciarra loves “Just Chatting” streams, and he’s happy they’re becoming more popular on the platform. He said they make the audience feel connected to the creator, which is an experience YouTube can’t match. 
</p> 

<p>“I love that… It’s more of just interacting with the community… [creators] are really big people, and a lot of people look up to them, so the concept of being able to sit down and just actually talk with the creator is fun,” he said. </p>

<p>Contrary to their genre’s name, “Just Chatting” streams do have more to offer. The creator under the username xQcOW spent a “Just Chatting” stream reacting to an episode of the competition television show Master Chef. At one point, his stream had over 91,000 viewers tuning in at the same time. 
</p>

<p>Throughout the stream, viewers interacted with the creator and each other through Twitch’s chat feature. Many of these viewers sent custom emojis called “emotes,” which can be purchased with a subscription starting at $4.99 a month. Félix Leyngel, the creator who goes by the screenname xQcOW, also took numerous advertising breaks, presumably how creators and the Twitch company make money in addition to subscriptions. </p>

<p>Leyngel is one of the platform’s most popular creators with 9.7 million Twitch followers, 1.1 million Twitter followers. He has the 6th greatest following on the platform, according to socialblade.com.

<p>Out of the 10 most popular Twitch Streamers, five of them most recently produced “Just Chatting” streams, according to Social Blade.
</p>

<p>There’s a cost to subscribe, but it is free to follow. Sciarra is following numerous streamers, but he said he doesn’t have the funds to subscribe to anyone. He is still getting a good experience from the platform because he gets notifications when his favorite creators go live, and he can still interact with the chat, just without the personal emotes. 
</p>

<p>Twitch also has a recommended page featuring creators the user may not be following, which explains how shroud has a similar view count to Ninja even with about eight million fewer subscribers.
</p>

<p>The emphasis on chatting streams is a new trend on Twitch. Before last April, gaming streams dominated the site. 
</p>

<p>League of Legends is a popular team-based video game, and these streams were the most viewed on Twitch for all of 2016 and most of 2017. Since January of 2016, League of Legends streams have always been in the top three most popular categories. 
</p>

<p>Rubin said League of Legends is one of the most popular games in the world right now. He said it’s a game he grew up with up, so watching other people play is nostalgic. His favorite game to watch is Rocket League, which was ranked 21 on the most popular stream genre in October 2021.

<p>What does the transition away from gaming mean for the platform’s future? Only time will tell. Rubin hasn’t been using Twitch as frequently as his life has gotten busier, and he started to lose some interest, but Sciarra, on the other hand, is excited to keep tuning in to see where the site goes. 
</p>

<p>He’s planning on streaming more frequently. He said the most viewers he’s ever had tune in was 60, but it was still fun, and it made him feel special that 60 people wanted to take the time to share live experiences with him.
